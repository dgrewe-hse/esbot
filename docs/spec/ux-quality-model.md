## 1. Clarity and Comprehensibility
### ISO 25010 Mapping
- **Usability** (Appropriateness Recognizability)  
- **Functional Suitability** (Functional Appropriateness)  
### Quality Criterion
Responses follow a clear, structured template (Definition → Importance → Example) and remain within x paragraphs or n sentences  
### Verification Method
Compare each response against the predefined template; automatically analyze text for paragraph count, bullet points, and sentence length; mark as Pass/Fail based on adherence  

## 2. Feedback Quality
### ISO 25010 Mapping
- **Usability** (User Error Protection, Learnability)  
- **Functional Suitability** (Functional Correctness)  
### Quality Criterion
Responses provide explanations for incorrect answers, highlighting why the answer was wrong and what the correct answer is, following a predefined feedback template  
### Verification Method
Compare each feedback response against the predefined feedback template; mark as Pass/Fail or on a qualitative scale (fully explains / partially explains / no explanation)  

## 3. Trust and Transparency
### ISO 25010 Mapping
- **Reliability** (Maturity)  
- **Security** (Integrity)  
### Quality Criterion
Responses indicate the source of information or explicitly state uncertainty when the answer might be ambiguous  
### Verification Method
Compare each response for presence of source references or explicit uncertainty statements; mark as Pass/Fail or on a qualitative scale (full transparency / partial transparency / none)  

## 4. Learnability (of the tool)
### ISO 25010 Mapping
- **Usability** (Learnability, Operability)
### Quality Criterion
The system clearly presents available features and guides first-time users in an intuitive way, making the bot’s capabilities immediately obvious  
### Verification Method
Compare first-launch interface against a predefined template of guidance elements (e.g., Quick-Start suggestions); mark as Fully / Partially / Not Learnable  

## 5. Error Tolerance and Recovery
### ISO 25010 Mapping
- **Reliability** (Fault Tolerance, Recoverability)
- **Usability** (User Error Protection)
### Quality Criterion
The system provides meaningful guidance or fallback responses for invalid, vague, or incorrect inputs, instead of crashing or showing cryptic errors  
### Verification Method
Compare system responses to a predefined template of expected fallback messages for invalid or unclear inputs; rate as Fully / Partially / Not Tolerant
