## 7.1 Black-Box Testing Techniques

We used black-box techniques here, so we only looked at the spec — no source code.
The relevant validation rules for `QuizRequest` are:

- `topic`: 3–100 characters
- `count`: integer, 1–10
- `difficulty`: must be `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`

---

### Step 1 – Equivalence Classes

#### `topic`

| Parameter | Class ID | Type    | Description                        | Test Value         |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `topic`   | EC-T-1   | Valid   | 3–100 characters                   | `"Python"`         |
| `topic`   | EC-T-2   | Invalid | shorter than 3 chars               | `"ab"`             |
| `topic`   | EC-T-3   | Invalid | longer than 100 chars              | `"a" * 101`        |
| `topic`   | EC-T-4   | Invalid | empty string or null               | `""` / `null`      |

#### `count`

| Parameter | Class ID | Type    | Description                        | Test Value  |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `count`   | EC-C-1   | Valid   | integer between 1 and 10           | `5`         |
| `count`   | EC-C-2   | Invalid | 0 or negative                      | `0`         |
| `count`   | EC-C-3   | Invalid | 11 or more                         | `11`        |
| `count`   | EC-C-4   | Invalid | wrong type (string, float, etc.)   | `"five"`    |
| `count`   | EC-C-5   | Invalid | null / not provided                | `null`      |

#### `difficulty`

| Parameter    | Class ID | Type    | Description                         | Test Value   |
|--------------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| `difficulty` | EC-D-1   | Valid   | `"easy"`                            | `"easy"`     |
| `difficulty` | EC-D-2   | Valid   | `"medium"`                          | `"medium"`   |
| `difficulty` | EC-D-3   | Valid   | `"hard"`                            | `"hard"`     |
| `difficulty` | EC-D-4   | Invalid | anything else                       | `"extreme"`  |
| `difficulty` | EC-D-5   | Invalid | empty or null                       | `""` / `null`|

---

### Step 2 – Justification + Boundary Value Analysis

**EC-T-1** – `"Python"` is a typical valid topic, nothing special about it, just a normal case. Represents all inputs that are within the allowed length. → FR3

Boundaries for `topic`:

| Position       | Value        | Length | Result   |
|----------------|--------------|--------|----------|
| just below min | `"ab"`       | 2      | rejected |
| minimum        | `"abc"`      | 3      | accepted |
| just above min | `"abcd"`     | 4      | accepted |
| just below max | `"a" * 99`   | 99     | accepted |
| maximum        | `"a" * 100`  | 100    | accepted |
| just above max | `"a" * 101`  | 101    | rejected |

**EC-T-2** – `"ab"` is one char below the minimum. All inputs in this class fail for the same reason, so one value is enough to represent them. → FR3

**EC-T-3** – `"a" * 101` is one char above the upper bound. Also relevant for NFR7 (security) since unbounded string inputs are a known risk.

**EC-T-4** – Empty/null is its own class, not the same as "too short". A missing topic means the whole request can't be processed. → FR3

**EC-C-1** – `5` is a mid-range valid value, no edge case involved. → FR3

Boundaries for `count`:

| Position       | Value | Result   |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| just below min | `0`   | rejected |
| minimum        | `1`   | accepted |
| just above min | `2`   | accepted |
| just below max | `9`   | accepted |
| maximum        | `10`  | accepted |
| just above max | `11`  | rejected |

**EC-C-2** – `0` is the most interesting boundary here — zero questions is semantically pointless. → FR3

**EC-C-3** – `11` is directly over the limit. → FR3

**EC-C-4** – `"five"` as a string where an integer is expected. The type check should happen before any range validation. → FR3, NFR7

**EC-C-5** – A missing count is different from 0 — the field just isn't there. → FR3

**EC-D-1/2/3** – The three accepted values each form their own class since the spec defines them as an explicit enum. All three need to work. → FR3

**EC-D-4** – `"extreme"` is a representative for all undefined difficulty values. Needs to be rejected so the AI doesn't get garbage input. → FR3, NFR7

**EC-D-5** – Same idea as EC-T-4: no value at all is different from a wrong value. → FR3

### Step 3 – Decision Table for Answer Evaluation (FR4)

Three conditions affect what happens when a student submits an answer:

| # | Condition | Values |
|---|-----------|--------|
| C1 | answer is empty/blank | yes / no |
| C2 | quiz item exists in session | yes / no |
| C3 | correctness (from AI) | correct / partial / incorrect |

C3 only matters when C1=No and C2=Yes. Otherwise it's a don't-care (–).

| Rule | C1: Empty | C2: Item exists | C3: Correctness | Output                                             | Req.       |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| R-01 | yes       | yes             | –               | error: answer is empty                             | FR4, NFR7  |
| R-02 | yes       | no              | –               | error: answer is empty                             | FR4, NFR7  |
| R-03 | no        | no              | –               | error: quiz item not found / session expired       | FR4, FR6   |
| R-04 | no        | yes             | correct         | positive feedback                                  | FR4        |
| R-05 | no        | yes             | partial         | partial feedback + explanation                     | FR4        |
| R-06 | no        | yes             | incorrect       | corrective feedback + explanation                  | FR4        |

- R-01 and R-02: empty check comes first regardless of whether the item exists.
- R-03: happens when a session expired while the user was still on the quiz page — realistic edge case.
- R-05: partial correctness is important for open-ended answers, a pure yes/no would lose information there.

## 7.2 State Transition Testing — Learning Session Lifecycle



### Step 1 — State Transition Diagram

![StateDiagram](stateDiagram.svg)

**Guard conditions:**
- Any interaction event (`submit_message`, `request_quiz`, `submit_answer`, `resume_session`) received in the **EXPIRED** state is **rejected** with a controlled error response. No state change occurs.
- `inactivity_timeout` in the **NEW** state is treated the same as in **ACTIVE** (the session becomes IDLE). Although rare, a session could be created but never used before the inactivity timer fires.
- `resume_session` is only meaningful from **IDLE**. In all other states it is either redundant (session is already ACTIVE / NEW) or rejected (EXPIRED).

---

### Step 2 — State Transition Table

All 4 states × 7 events = 28 combinations. Invalid transitions are marked with **–** as the next state.

| Current State | Event              | Next State | Output / Action                                                              | Req.       |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| NEW           | submit_message     | ACTIVE     | Message accepted; session context initialised; interaction history started   | FR6, FR1   |
| NEW           | request_quiz       | ACTIVE     | Quiz request accepted; session context initialised                           | FR6, FR3   |
| NEW           | submit_answer      | –          | **Rejected** — return controlled error: "no active quiz in session"          | FR6, NFR3  |
| NEW           | inactivity_timeout | IDLE       | Session marked IDLE; no interaction yet; resumable                           | FR6        |
| NEW           | session_timeout    | EXPIRED    | Session terminated; no further interactions accepted                         | FR6        |
| NEW           | close_session      | EXPIRED    | Session explicitly closed                                                    | FR6        |
| NEW           | resume_session     | NEW        | No-op / ignored — session is already in initial state; no error              | FR6        |
| ACTIVE        | submit_message     | ACTIVE     | Message accepted; conversation history updated                               | FR6, FR1   |
| ACTIVE        | request_quiz       | ACTIVE     | Quiz generated; session context updated                                      | FR6, FR3   |
| ACTIVE        | submit_answer      | ACTIVE     | Answer evaluated; feedback returned; session context updated                 | FR6, FR3   |
| ACTIVE        | inactivity_timeout | IDLE       | Session marked IDLE; state preserved; user can resume later                  | FR6        |
| ACTIVE        | session_timeout    | EXPIRED    | Session terminated; stored for reference only; no new interactions           | FR6        |
| ACTIVE        | close_session      | EXPIRED    | Session explicitly closed by student or system                               | FR6        |
| ACTIVE        | resume_session     | ACTIVE     | No-op / ignored — session is already active; no error                        | FR6        |
| IDLE          | submit_message     | ACTIVE     | Auto-resume triggered; message accepted; session reactivated                 | FR6, FR5   |
| IDLE          | request_quiz       | ACTIVE     | Auto-resume triggered; quiz request accepted; session reactivated            | FR6, FR5   |
| IDLE          | submit_answer      | ACTIVE     | Auto-resume triggered; answer accepted; session reactivated                  | FR6, FR5   |
| IDLE          | inactivity_timeout | IDLE       | Already IDLE; no change; timer reset                                         | FR6        |
| IDLE          | session_timeout    | EXPIRED    | Maximum session lifetime exceeded; session terminated                        | FR6        |
| IDLE          | close_session      | EXPIRED    | Session explicitly closed while idle                                         | FR6        |
| IDLE          | resume_session     | ACTIVE     | Session explicitly resumed; interaction history accessible again             | FR6, FR5   |
| EXPIRED       | submit_message     | –          | **Rejected** — return controlled error: "session expired, please start new" | FR6, NFR3  |
| EXPIRED       | request_quiz       | –          | **Rejected** — return controlled error: "session expired, please start new" | FR6, NFR3  |
| EXPIRED       | submit_answer      | –          | **Rejected** — return controlled error: "session expired, please start new" | FR6, NFR3  |
| EXPIRED       | inactivity_timeout | EXPIRED    | No-op — session is already terminated; timer ignored                         | FR6        |
| EXPIRED       | session_timeout    | EXPIRED    | No-op — session is already terminated; timer ignored                         | FR6        |
| EXPIRED       | close_session      | EXPIRED    | No-op — session is already closed                                            | FR6        |
| EXPIRED       | resume_session     | –          | **Rejected** — return controlled error: "session expired, cannot resume"    | FR6, NFR3  |

### Step 3 — Test Case Derivation (All-Transitions Coverage)

The minimum set below covers every **valid** transition at least once, plus one sequence that deliberately exercises **invalid** transitions to verify controlled error behaviour.

---

#### TS-01 — Happy Path: New → Active → Idle → Active → Expired

Verifies the standard lifecycle including inactivity and explicit close.

| Step | Start State | Event              | Expected Next State | Expected Output / Action                                | Req.      |
|------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1    | NEW         | submit_message     | ACTIVE              | Message accepted; session context initialised           | FR6, FR1  |
| 2    | ACTIVE      | request_quiz       | ACTIVE              | Quiz generated; session context updated                 | FR6, FR3  |
| 3    | ACTIVE      | submit_answer      | ACTIVE              | Answer evaluated; feedback returned                     | FR6, FR3  |
| 4    | ACTIVE      | inactivity_timeout | IDLE                | Session marked IDLE; user notified if applicable        | FR6       |
| 5    | IDLE        | resume_session     | ACTIVE              | Session reactivated; history accessible                 | FR6, FR5  |
| 6    | ACTIVE      | submit_message     | ACTIVE              | Message accepted; conversation history updated          | FR6, FR1  |
| 7    | ACTIVE      | close_session      | EXPIRED             | Session explicitly closed                               | FR6       |

---

#### TS-02 — Session Timeout from Active State

Verifies that the session_timeout event terminates an active session.

| Step | Start State | Event           | Expected Next State | Expected Output / Action                                    | Req. |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| 1    | NEW         | request_quiz    | ACTIVE              | Quiz request accepted; session initialised                  | FR6  |
| 2    | ACTIVE      | session_timeout | EXPIRED             | Session terminated; lifetime exceeded                       | FR6  |

---

#### TS-03 — Idle → Expired via Session Timeout

Verifies that session_timeout from IDLE state terminates the session correctly.

| Step | Start State | Event              | Expected Next State | Expected Output / Action                             | Req. |
|------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------|
| 1    | NEW         | submit_message     | ACTIVE              | Message accepted; session initialised                | FR6  |
| 2    | ACTIVE      | inactivity_timeout | IDLE                | Session marked IDLE                                  | FR6  |
| 3    | IDLE        | session_timeout    | EXPIRED             | Maximum lifetime exceeded; session terminated        | FR6  |

---

#### TS-04 — Auto-Resume from Idle via Interaction Event

Verifies that submitting a message while IDLE reactivates the session automatically (covers IDLE → ACTIVE via submit_message, request_quiz, submit_answer).

| Step | Start State | Event              | Expected Next State | Expected Output / Action                              | Req.      |
|------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1    | NEW         | submit_message     | ACTIVE              | Session initialised                                   | FR6       |
| 2    | ACTIVE      | inactivity_timeout | IDLE                | Session marked IDLE                                   | FR6       |
| 3    | IDLE        | submit_message     | ACTIVE              | Auto-resume; message accepted; history preserved      | FR6, FR5  |
| 4    | ACTIVE      | inactivity_timeout | IDLE                | Session marked IDLE again                             | FR6       |
| 5    | IDLE        | request_quiz       | ACTIVE              | Auto-resume; quiz request accepted                    | FR6, FR5  |
| 6    | ACTIVE      | inactivity_timeout | IDLE                | Session marked IDLE again                             | FR6       |
| 7    | IDLE        | submit_answer      | ACTIVE              | Auto-resume; answer accepted                          | FR6, FR5  |
| 8    | ACTIVE      | close_session      | EXPIRED             | Session closed                                        | FR6       |

---

#### TS-05 — New Session Timeout and Close

Covers NEW → EXPIRED via both timeout and explicit close (two sub-paths).

| Step | Start State | Event           | Expected Next State | Expected Output / Action                              | Req. |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------|
| 1    | NEW         | session_timeout | EXPIRED             | Session terminated before any interaction             | FR6  |

*(Second sub-path: step 1 with `close_session` event — same expected outcome.)*

---

#### TS-06 — Invalid Transitions on Expired Session (negative test)

Verifies that all interaction events on an EXPIRED session are rejected with a controlled error. This sequence covers the FR6 / NFR3 requirement for graceful degradation.

| Step | Start State | Event           | Expected Next State | Expected Output / Action                                          | Req.      |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1    | NEW         | submit_message  | ACTIVE              | Session initialised                                               | FR6       |
| 2    | ACTIVE      | close_session   | EXPIRED             | Session closed                                                    | FR6       |
| 3    | EXPIRED     | submit_message  | – (invalid)         | **Controlled error:** "session expired, please start a new one"  | FR6, NFR3 |
| 4    | EXPIRED     | request_quiz    | – (invalid)         | **Controlled error:** "session expired, please start a new one"  | FR6, NFR3 |
| 5    | EXPIRED     | submit_answer   | – (invalid)         | **Controlled error:** "session expired, please start a new one"  | FR6, NFR3 |
| 6    | EXPIRED     | resume_session  | – (invalid)         | **Controlled error:** "session expired, cannot resume"           | FR6, NFR3 |

The system must **not** crash, silently accept the event, or transition to any new state. Returning a structured error response (HTTP 4xx with a meaningful error body) satisfies NFR3 (Reliability) and is consistent with the edge case "session state missing or expired" identified in earlier exercises.

## 7.3 Reflection — Test Design Technique Comparison

### Complementarity of the Techniques

The three techniques focus on different kinds of problems and complement each other well.

**Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) and Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** are best for validating user input and API parameters. In the ESBot project, this was especially useful for the `QuizRequest` validation rules from FR3. For example, the `topic` field has strict length constraints (3–100 characters). Instead of testing every possible string length, ECP grouped the inputs into meaningful valid and invalid classes, while BVA focused on the critical edge values like 2, 3, 100, and 101 characters. This gives high coverage with relatively few tests.

**Decision tables** are strongest when system behaviour depends on combinations of independent conditions. The answer evaluation feature from FR4 is a good example because the output depends on multiple factors at once: whether the answer is empty, whether the quiz item still exists, and whether the answer is correct, partially correct, or incorrect. A decision table makes these combinations explicit and helps prevent missing edge cases that are easy to overlook in informal testing.

**State transition testing** is most useful when behaviour depends on history or lifecycle state. The `UserSession` lifecycle from FR6 and FR5 clearly falls into this category. A session behaves differently depending on whether it is `NEW`, `ACTIVE`, `IDLE`, or `EXPIRED`. State-based testing made it possible to verify both normal flows (e.g. resume after inactivity) and invalid transitions (e.g. submitting a message after expiration). This technique is especially valuable for backend systems that maintain persistent session context.

### Gaps and Alternative Techniques

Even together, the three techniques do not cover every important ESBot behaviour equally well.

One important gap is the quality and semantic correctness of AI-generated responses. For example, FR1 and FR4 involve natural-language explanations and feedback produced by the AI model. ECP, decision tables, and state transition testing can verify that a response exists and that the correct workflow is triggered, but they cannot determine whether the explanation is actually pedagogically useful, factually correct, or understandable for students.

For this type of behaviour, **exploratory testing** and **scenario-based testing** would be more appropriate. Human reviewers can evaluate answer quality, clarity, tone, and educational usefulness in realistic learning situations. In addition, some aspects of ESBot would benefit from **performance and load testing**, especially session persistence and concurrent quiz generation under higher user load. Those non-functional aspects are outside the primary scope of the three techniques used in this exercise.

### Effort vs. Value

For the ESBot project, **state transition testing** produced the highest defect-detection value relative to the design effort.

The reason is that session handling affects almost every major feature in the system. Requirements such as FR5 and FR6 depend heavily on correct lifecycle management, and many realistic edge cases occur only because of state changes over time. Examples include users returning after inactivity, sessions expiring during a quiz, or interactions being submitted after termination. These kinds of defects are often difficult to detect with isolated input validation tests alone.

Compared to ECP and decision tables, the state model required more initial effort to design, but it also uncovered a larger variety of realistic failure scenarios. In particular, the invalid transition analysis helped verify graceful error handling required by NFR3. Since session management is central to ESBot’s reliability and user experience, the value gained from state transition testing was especially high for this project.
